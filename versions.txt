Additions
- Added other countries to get their weather too
  Go to http://xoap.weather.com/search/search?where= and type your location there
  And it will display location id's, choose which one you need
  
  eg "http://xoap.weather.com/search/search?where=Rome Italy"
  <loc id="ITXX0067" type="1">Rome, Italy</loc>
  So use ITXX0067 in the config file

- Added unit measurement (s for standard/m for Metric)

- Added in other weather icons
  These were edited icons from a pack called Konfabulator.
  I just made a black background, very crappy job, but I'm no computer graphic artist.

- Up to 9 location ID's can be now stored in the config file, please make sure the
  totalIds tag is set accordingly to how many you have.
